            <h3>Wrike</h3>
            <p>Wrike is a web-based project management software similar to Smartsheet that can be installed on any device or accessed on any PC platform. Wrike allows the user to interact with task through Gantt chart, table view (similar to MS), Timelog view, Workload view, Board view (similar to card view of Smartsheet) and list view. Wrike excels in providing its users with a wide variety of option on how to manage and view task</p>
			<p>Most users are guided at the start of a new project to List view, in list view you are told by the wrike to add a new project by creating a folder and naming it, then each phase is added by a creating a new subfolder inside the project folder and filling those subfolders with task.</p>
			<p>Wrike does not allow the user to auto schedule the task but it does allow the user to backlog a task if the user does not know the finish date of a task or attach its finish date to a particular milestone. Each task can be shared with multiple users, user can also follow a task which notifies the user to any update to the task through mail.</p>
			<p>Wrike does not allow a user to add members to a task part time but it does allow each member assigned to a task to use a timer to time himself and record how long it took him to complete a task this can be particular helpful if members are paid by the hour and not on a contract. User can also check the workload of an individual by simply on workload view and drag and drop task amongst members if he feels a need to change things.</p>
			<p>Similar to SmartSheet, Wrike also has a dedicated dashboard which allows the user complete control over a project or multiple projects. User can view the progress of a project or a phase or even a particular task through the dashboard. The dashboard can also display information regarding overdue project through a widget and has a default widget called Conflicts Monitor which show any planned task that has pushed past its dependent milestone.</p>
			<p>Wrike allows the user to generate reports in multiples forms like MS project and Smartsheet and share them with members or client by just entering their mail.</p>
