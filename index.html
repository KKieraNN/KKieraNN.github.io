                <h3>Project Managment Wiki</h3>
                <p>
				A Project Management Software (PMS) has the capacity to help plan, organize, and manage resource tools and develop resource estimates. 
				In this project we have been tasked to find two alternative project management software to MS Project that is currently in use at AUT. Our research has helped us identify two PMS that we believe are viable alternatives to MS Project, the two PMS project are Wrike and Smartsheet. 
				The team decided on Wrike and Smartsheet as they both have similar functionality to MS project while also being available on a monthly fee as a SaaS. 
				In this wiki we will compare the functionality of MS Project to Wrike and Smartsheet to assist the client in selecting one for their R&D project.
