            <h3>Smartsheet</h3>
			<p>Smartsheet is a web-based software project management software that can be installed on any device or PC platform, it features a minimal interface with a toolbar and it allows the users view task through a Gantt char, grid view, calendar view and a card view. Card view is unique feature that allows users to view the status of all task or who the task is assigned to and then drag and drop them if he needs to make a change. </p>
			<p>When a user creates a new project, Smartsheet provides the user with the option of either selecting a blank sheet and adding all the field we want in our project manually or the user can select a project template which has all the basic field like task Description, start and finish date but lacks the ability to add new field that user might want to add.</p>
			<p>Smartsheet also allows the user to auto schedule their task when provide with task duration and dependencies which help the user to plan out their project in an efficient manner. User can also share the smartsheet with multiple people and give them permission to either view or edit fields that they are assigned to, this helps the user to maintain overall control of the project. </p>
			<p>Task can be assigned to members using the drop-down Assign To box or dragging and dropping the task in a member field in card view which is very helpful tool as it also allows the user to see the workload each member is currently under. Task can also be inserted or deleted by right clicking the project sheet and choosing insert/delete task but unlike MS project it does not allow you to link two projects together using a link task button, user must manually enter the task number in dependencies to link two tasks together which can be particularly difficult in large projects where a user deletes or add task on a regular basis. Smartsheet does not allow the user to add a member to task part time.</p>
			<p>Smartsheet also features a dedicated dashboard which allows the user configure widgets of what information he wants to see of a particular project or monitor several projects at once, this can be in form of a gantt charts, project status or budget report. While Smartsheet allows you to look at the workload for each member in the card view it does not allow automatically calculate project or task cost. The user must enter that information manually either by writing a formula as you would in excel or by manually entering cost of each task in the project sheet. [IMG]</p>
			<p>User can also generate reports at the end of their project like Project summary and Milestone report.</p>
